#### By _**Chloe Hellberg and Jeffry Fleischer, 7.7.20**_

## Description

_This application allows the user to enter three separate numbers all adding up to 180 degrees to check what type of triangle it is. If the user enters three numbers greater than 180 it will communciate to the user it is not a triangle. If the user enters equal numbers all adding up to 180, it will communicate that it is an equilateral triangle. If the user enters 2 numbers in equal degrees and a third number that all add up to 180 degrees, then the application will communicate that it is an isosceles triangle. If the user enters three numbers of varying degrees and it adds up to 180 degrees, it will communicate that it is a scalene triangle._
